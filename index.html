                            Remember this day, babe?
                            Every time I see this picture, it’s like I’m pressing play on one of my favorite memories. I can still picture you being all shy and sweet, standing so close but not quite touching like a cautious cat sniffing a new pillow. I kept trying to sneak in a hug, but it always felt a bit off… until this moment.

                            That hug? It wasn’t just a hug. It was the hug. It was like my arms finally found their home. Warmth, comfort, peace—like hugging a human sized cup of hot chocolate on a rainy day. I swear, I could hear my heart go, “Welp, we’re done looking. We found her.”

                            You made me feel loved, safe, and like the world was suddenly okay again. You’re my sunshine and my storm shelter, all in one adorable package. I love you more than pizza (and you know that’s saying a lot).

                            Just knowing I get to have you by my side through the highs, lows, and the “I’m not mad, I’m just hungry” moments makes life so much better. Can’t wait for the many silly, sweet, and cuddly days still ahead of us. 💖

                Rosa,

I miss you more than I can put into words — though a thousand songs still try. Every part of me aches to see you again. Your smile, your laugh… the way your eyes light up like constellations when you're talking about something you love.

Some days I feel like I’ve been left in pieces, trying to stitch myself back together, but it’s you I’m missing most. Like “Stitches”, it hurts in all the places you once healed.

There’s not a single day I don’t think of you. I catch myself “counting stars” instead of sheep, wondering if somewhere, under the same sky, you’re thinking of me too. You’ve always been the spark in my chaos, the “high, high, high” when life felt low.

I remember the way you held me — like forever wasn’t long enough. And even now, I still feel that. Like “say you won’t let go” was less of a lyric and more of a promise we made with every look.

You’re my safe place, my home — even when distance stretches between us. And even though “flowers need rain”, and we’ve weathered storms, you’ve never stopped blooming in my heart.

I would’ve crossed every line to hold you again, like “there’s nothing holdin’ me back” — because when love is this real, this deep, you rewrite every star that tried to separate us.

I know I’m not perfect, but I swear “I could treat you better” than any version of myself before you. I’ve grown, because of you.

So until I’m wrapped in your arms again, just “hold on.” Know that every beat of my heart is a step closer to you.

“Forever and ever and always.” That’s not just a lyric. That’s the truth I carry in every breath.

You’re not just someone I loved — you’re someone I’ll always love.
Even when I feel like “someone you loved” — I know, deep down, you’re still mine.

I love you endlessly, Rosa. In this life and every next.

— Me, always yours
